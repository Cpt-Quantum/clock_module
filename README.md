# Clock Module
This repo contains the schematic and PCB design for a clock module that features both a variable frequency clock (from a 555 timer) and a single step mode. The schematic is based very closely on Ben Eater's design (https://eater.net/8bit/clock), and will be used alongside his breadboard 6502 project.
